Music Playlist Manager App

Purpose and Features 
This is an app created in Android Studio using the programming language kotlin.  It stores song details whereby users can be able to create and manage their playlists. Users can therefore be able to give information about artists, give ratings and comment.  This specific app give four songs though. 
Key features:
Feature 1:  The app uses four parallel arrays whereby one is for the song title, artist name, rating, and comments 
Feature 2:  The app uses a for...loop to display the songs when the display view screen button is clicked.   

Design Considerations 
The app has been designed with 2 screens. The Main Screen and the Detailed View Screen.

Github
As I was coding the app, I kept pushing the codes to github which helped me keep track of my changes.

Challenges and Learnings: 
Challenge 1: My app faced some IDE issues when I was trying to run it. It kept terminating. 
Solution: So I did some checks and found out that the issue was with my XML. With my imageview I had accidentally put "src" before the "drawable" feature. 
Challenge 2: My app was now running but my exit button on the review screen was not closing the app. 
Solution: So I went back to my ReviewActivity of my kotlin code and realised that I had closed off the code with finish() which only closes one screen and not the entire app.  So I went to edit that code rather to 
finishaffinity() so the entire app can close.
